/******************************************************************************

Create a class named weather report that holds a daily weather report
with data memberâ€™s day_of_month, hightemp, lowtemp, amount_rain
and amount_snow. The constructor initializes the fields with default
values: 99 for day_of_month, 999 for hightemp,-999 for low emp and 0
for amount_rain and amount_snow. Include a function that prompts the
user and sets values for each field so that you can override the default
values. Write a C++ program that creates a monthly report. a) Menu driven program with options to Enter data and Display report
b) Report Format
Day High_ Temp Low_Temp Amt_snow Amt_Rain
